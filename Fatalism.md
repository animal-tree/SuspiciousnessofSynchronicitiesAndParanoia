_ has a boyfriend, so what was the point of all of the meeting, and linguistics, and where we are now—blocked, I think. I think?

My linguistics and temperament — yours too — your storytelling facets — want some fast paced accelerative process of climactic poetry, and the linguistics deceptively promise me that while every time the actual mechanics of meaning created by the universe happen almost imperceptibly slowly and perceptibly disappointingly. 

Those storytelling mechanics — yours too — want God to have a plan and be able to plan around us, individual people, our souls, our minds, our decisions.

_ is evidence that God doesn’t much have that planning capacity.

He arranged symbolic meetings, but not experiences. My fault or not, God’s planning — the universe God’s — is what’s in question (owing to the synchronicities). The result is no. He can’t plan. He leaves free will for us, and plans kind of fatalistically around our mistakes. He predicts multiple paths and then chooses the plans that converge based on our decisions. He can’t afford that and guarantee me an experience at the same time. Such is His limitation. 

Fatalism and free will, as opposed to determinism and a prewritten plan, is beneficial because TBD.

My guess is “God” is still evolving and much of Him — universe God — is still dumb. The parts that have disambiguated intelligence to me were probably from components, like “Congressmen,” intelligent or not, belonging to an unintelligent government.
