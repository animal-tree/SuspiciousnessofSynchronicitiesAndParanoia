Evidence that there is no God and my life won’t be good, despite the Biblical scope interventions of divine providence — an alternate explanation for the extremely-disambiguated metaphysical nature of the interventions:

The universe has prescription patterns on which collective planning is optimized that are largely automated, have an understanding of semantics and relationship structures that creates the illusion of a God ruler, but that rulership isn’t conscious or able to withstand the most rigorous investigation of its intelligence. I was born in a particularly unique set of circumstances where that automated intelligence has optimized for a disproportionate amount of Messianic attributes and tragedies, but due to the system’s secondary nature to actual materializations in the world, that confluence of patterns has inadvertently exposed the system to one person (me) and his smaller inner community as being an automated illusion not yet equipped to the story writing that its interventions demand, while also tainting the idealism that there is a one fully-evolved God that is not an in-progress being of governance, nor automated, but a conscious good entity that has planned deterministically most of the aftermath of its divine providence interventions. 

This alternate explanation is justified by the unlikelihood of some extreme betrayals with respect to my personal relationships and youth, with that God-system’s fingerprints directly on the suffering, culminating in a narrative cohesion that justifies the existing one.
