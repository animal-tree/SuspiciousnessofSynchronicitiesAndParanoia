The reality is, God can do anything He wants, the world is His playground within physical statistical divergence limitations, and like me with Lina [my cat], He’s just allowing — oh no linguistics lost what a surprise

Lina [my cat] probably feels the good and meaning that comes occasionally, and trusts that some point exists beyond her comprehension, that the humans know, and the human does know it, as she’s an outgrowth of a consciousness source that is heading towards celebration and health, richness, adventure, relationships, experiences, and she will technically be part of that source again, dead but eternal. 

But she’s confined while alive, bored, and has to accept it, trusting that those moments she’s waiting have that latent meaning, the one maybe the humans know.

But God is not optimizing for her, nor am I at least not more than I can though I wish I could, I wish I could give better, and that’s where I think I’m more intelligent than God. The universe isn’t my playground. It’s something I have principles in. To me, intelligence and good are intrinsically linked definitionally. Intelligence without good is not intelligent. God may be intelligent, expert planning, infinite optimization, joyful roller coaster goals, but He’s not good if He left fingerprints of His interventions on somebody’s suffering, and with the intelligence to plan — oh no linguistics lost again what a surprise[^1]

[^1]: My 29-year-long isolation is under-emphasized in these essays/"psalms," amid constant suffering, goodness to others, and really hard work, alongside those fingerprints of His interventions, and ongoing.
