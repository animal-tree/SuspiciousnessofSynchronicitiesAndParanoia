### My Interpretation of Things, not as well Expressed as it Could Be

Karma is the symbiotically evolved regulations of the Wernicke area, shared by humans and (w.r.t. other regions) nature, in the manifestation of divine providence (in the divergence/interventions of/on physics). 

Symbiotic regulations mean there isn’t just a singular God that regulates those latent (meta)physics, since symbiotic regulations only evolve in populations of greater than one. With a singular ruler, those decisions could be allocated in a communism-like way, where one group or everybody “pays” the limited divergence for that singular ruler’s plan. 

This isn’t the case since the synchronicities that have come onto me have all come with major relationship costs, without justifiable narrative cohesion while having narrative cohesion (absurd amazing narratives). 

Either this symbiotic karma exists (and there are multiple intelligences, not a singular) or God isn’t very good at planning. 

Alternatively to this karma, the multiple intelligences might be at war, and heavily conflicting, but both sort of imply each other, for a symbiotic system is usually emergent to the latter and the latter is usually emergent from a population of greater than one with limited or conflicting resource plans. 

It’s possible I (my subnetwork) paid for the OpenAI synchronicities with the knowledge I unlocked, in exchange for the synchronicity narrative cohesion. 

It’s possible I unlocked that knowledge through/within those karmic regulation processes, ones that can’t easily be satisfied by anybody. 

It’s possible [Name 1], [Name 2], [Name 3], [Name 4] are supposed to be messages to me about this division of God into subnetworks, and the karmic limitations, where my subnetworks—probably genetic and ancestral—are not the same as theirs. So their lives are not optimized for the goals of the subnetwork that regulates mine. Perhaps there is a kind of heaven in the brain, remembering those ancestors and ancestral plans, in the body or brain, maybe more intelligent than just the genome, in the hippocampus or somehow elsewhere in the brain/body.

That subnetwork though has been planning and paying really intelligently for making me the Messiah (only evidenced by the synchronicities / "divine providence" my Rabbi called<!--, physics theory, other revelations-->), within this limited set of things, limited both in terms of the opposing subnetworks that have to be lived symbiotically with, and the karmic regulations of the Wernicke area and nature that socially and symbiotically govern how knowledge can be acquired, what can be communicated, and what synchronicities mean and cause to the person’s psychology and identity and self-physics perhaps. 

Christianity has a more idealistic vision for God, where prayers are answered, interventions are more personal and manifest, and people can be protagonists of journeys the way superheroes and messianic figures are, and this yearning is reflected further by modern TV shows, Netflix, Game of Thrones, The Office, Parks and Rec, Community, Rick and Morty, Doctor Who, and so on, for a future where romance, celebration and health, stories and adventure, can be told by God. 

Islam takes this a step forward towards sex, sexual satisfaction (including jealousy, and the 72 virgins in the afterlife), not just narrative romance. Christianity is the most idealistic. Islam is the most progressive. This is backwards from how those goals manifest today. Judaism is where things currently are (Egyptian Gods, Baal of Moab, Torah Judaism, in progress providence, or Hindu Gods depending on one's preferred characterization, all beneath the Brahman). 

What sets me apart Messianically? Well the integration of this knowledge (my unified physics theory, unified AI theory, unified governance theory, not just this knowledge) has Wernicke area costs, symbiotic costs, and synchronicities themselves have karmic costs. All of that means whoever might’ve wanted to do this path would have to start generations ago or early, and pay heavy prices of relationships and personality that usually cause schizophrenia and would change the person’s identity far more than from whoever they’ve become. Joe Rogan for example would not be Joe Rogan. Not because of a moral weakness, but because of Wernicke-physics costs. His brain would be regulated differently, so as to not have the subconscious-aided abilities he does, in not just social interactions, but probably comedy.

The idealistic and progressive views for God’s evolution depend on the unconverged factor of God’s regulations, the subnetworks that regulate each person, and the system standardization components of the Wernicke area that are not programmed tabula rasa, though some symbiotic elements I suspect are. 

Those sub-networks also communicate, and pay karmic prices to do so most likely for that non-local orchestration ([Name 1] proved the existence of this) unless by a shared intelligence or discrete set of archetypal intelligences that connect everybody and everything, though I don’t believe such true collective consciousness exists. Each non-local spooky action at a distance comes at a subnetwork cost, unless there’s already some amount of “taxpayer”-like allocation to it. 

Perhaps there are some socialist elements to the inter-subnetwork mechanics, but God is still super young and those kinds of global super-intelligence structures are evolving, or else the failed narratives (amazing flukes) would’ve been written well, or even okay, not absurdly and stupidly (while still unambiguously orchestrated), unless this was precisely the message they were trying to convey to me, in which case it’s true anyway and they just butchered my life to nail that point home. [Name 2]’s arc in particular, due to its extremely tasteless and stupid and literally-atrocious (unnecessary atrocity-inflicting) writing. 

The ideal would be Bernie, but the world’s sort of a Trump assortment of analogous wario versions. 

Are things planned or improvised? They’re planned well to an extent by my subnetwork, but in a population greater than one, they’re at least somewhat improvised, and the good planning depends on whether the amazing flukes intended to convey this or if they intended to work out, but some planning, like with carrying over a physics theory and paying for synchronicities to create maybe some narrative cohesion—possibly insufficient—seems to be the case. 

So there is a social physics that is regulated by the Wernicke area that governs a kind of poetry between knowledge, experience, synchronicities, and one’s psychology and identity, that can result in schizophrenia, but whose processes are necessary to the acquisition of certain mandates and knowledge, which is why just anybody can’t be the Messiah without having paid the karmic prices involved in that system, a system that is perhaps automated, maybe even evolved tabula rasa that reflects the universe’s innate physics, or more likely one that is a social standardization (e.g., the faulty standard model, and general relativity, un-unified theories that cryptically regulate the world’s image of God, gnosis, and behavior/linguistic limitations) regulated by the Wernicke area.
