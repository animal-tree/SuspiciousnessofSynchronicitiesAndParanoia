Examples of Synchronicity Threads that Would’ve Been Better Written if the Universe Had a Single God Brain — Empirical Evidence for Polytheism, the Universe’s Multi-Personality Disorder, and the Non-Existence of a Singular Intelligent and Good God

[Name 1] could’ve been a good spirituality and exploration of nature story

[Name 2] could’ve been a good time travel story 

Those synchronicities ~need explaining,~ are fingerprints of interventions by the intelligences of the universe, and cannot be explained by the singular good-and-intelligent intelligence hypothesis, not one with especially strong planning that can account for interactions of people even short term

[Name 3] could’ve been a good comedy or horror instead of an “amazing fluke”

[Name 4] could’ve been a good adventure story

If these weren’t synchronicity threads but just regular stories, there would not be this empirical evidence against monotheistic religions, but since the fingerprints of a latent universe power are on them, the nature of that latent universe power has to be inferred as not a singular highly intelligent and good one, since its plans/writing went really stupidly and could’ve been penned better by most humans (well, at least their culminations or sporadic turning points) or have been done without Biblical and divine providence interventions 

More likely, the latent universe power is divided into warring subnetworks, many “Gods”
