What is my best argument against God’s plans being long-term, memory being long-term, and intelligence and good all being wise?

I’m gonna assume familiarity with all of my explanations regarding the general-case evidence that that isn’t the case (<!--<a href='https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V3-in-progress/blob/main/7)%20Philosophy/Dormant-Communications.md'>-->why it can be<!--</a>-->).

More generally, and including the cases surrounding me, the issue is an anticlimactic poetry to the interventions, wherein the poetry is not especially artful, and is especially disrespectful. The highest intelligence and wisdom, with long-term planning and memory, would write their interventions better, especially on me since I haven’t had climactic amounts of justifying success commensurate to the Biblical scale of divine intervention and providence of suffering.

I’m assuming familiarity with my tragedies and synchronicities<!-- ([some listed here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms-V3-in-progress/tree/main), some [others here](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/Does-anyone-else-think-this-is-proof-of-God%3F.md), not exhaustive)-->.

What would convince me in my life personally would be miracles devoted to me that are meant to please, satisfy, fulfill, and truly fill the gap in what I’m missing, in me—but do so successfully. Why? Because it would convey love, good planning, and extreme intelligence, one that is transcendent of me. Miracles that know me. Miracles that see into me deeper than I do. Miracles like having met _ in 2017, except without the failure. Or _ for that matter. Like _, but without the failure. Like _ and _, or _ and _—maybe better since I was still lacking a basic want. A complement to my being that proves God planned—well. 

Unlike the ordinary case, God’s interventions prevented my success, meaning there are fingerprints to his doing that can’t be explained away by my other explanations for why suffering happens, which can explain even the Holocaust and the worst atrocities, as long as God’s fingerprints aren’t on them.

So I need see God planned well.

Nearing 30, I’m skeptical this is the case. Being bald (through arguably God’s doing), and wanting attraction—intimate attraction—from someone, I’m doubting this is the case. Being _ is married, I’m suspicious this is the case. All of this, and wanting to reciprocate, and at full heights of genuine attraction and appreciation and self-ness, I’m skeptical this is the case. <!--Being that much of my work may require battling an entire monopoly by myself, perhaps legal battles *on the defensive*, and arguing, or perhaps my work being ignored, rejected, or not appreciated, as I’m doing it without pay or dignity.-->

The odds are extremely low, and there is an alternate explanation for the synchronicities. Projections and/or bad planning from a limited, fallible, improvising, God singular or non-locally woven human-system collective brain. And while that would be interesting news to deliver, the incentive system of that intelligence is too low for my suffering and work.
