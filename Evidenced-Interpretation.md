# Evidenced interpretation

The universe has some prescription patterns that go beyond fundamental physics towards optimizing symmetries, even semantic ones, and things like that. That could manifest as cyclicality or synchronicity, and it’s deceptive because those semantic connections seem to suggest a higher intelligence, when in all likelihood it is a much lower one, basically pretty much an automated intelligence that reasons enough about semantics over time via some weighing of interpretations based on what people in the world think and understand, so as to autonomously and pretty impartially perhaps preserve those different interpretation frameworks as much as possible and while creating as much symmetric connectivity, e.g., recurring time periods or synchronicities, as possible, within the standard deviation range of quantum physics, which is probabilistic and therefore has some standard deviation leeway for behavior in the universe to be subtly optimized in such a respect.<sup>$\text{\color{green}[1.]}$</sup> There’s probably also emerged some hack where some elements of consciousness are really rigged towards structures of power that have nothing to do with beauty or symmetry or good narrative or anything like that. But in principle, the idea of this second-law of physics is to create a universe masterpiece, where perhaps the symmetries are conflated by the designers or controllers of this second-law (us probably, but collectively, and somehow with power structure biases that have emerged, perhaps due to the role of organized religion in defining for the collective what these prescription patterns should be) as beauty when, in its current form, the optimizations are closer to fascism than beauty. These optimizations are able to directly cause injustices themselves, just as organized religion is, and those inflictions can disproportionately fall on one individual somehow, to a point that defies all reason and borders on absurdity, but suggests that probably there are also forces amid this optimization process — though perhaps much less powerful — that have longer memories or better purposes, or which are less adaptive to certain kinds of individuals. 

I think the world as it is, these mechanisms, have backfired in extremely unjust ways against me that disproportionately prove themselves and the nature of their injustice, in such a way that puts them in a relationship of perpetual abuse over me, and to such extents of destruction that all justification for living, for me, is done. 

The evidence<sup>$\text{\color{green}[2.]}$</sup> I have for this is not shared. My mom, a lifelong atheist, was even convinced by the patterned events that happened — unshared here — that yes, something exists. 

$\text{\color{green}[1.]:}$  The manner of this probably has something to do with the mechanisms of consciousness, more fundamental to quantum physics than emergent-neurology interpretations believe, and those mechanisms as evolved in the collective symbiosis. 

$\text{\color{green}[2.]:}$ The universe’s patterned physics-revealing arrangements — not described here, but involving long-form non-local planning and unambiguous symmetry in the form of cyclicality and synchronicity — have demonstrated an extremely patterned non-random structure that can only be attributed to some sort of intelligence within that system, but in which were caused severe injustices, through the behavioral and psychological influences of such disambiguated metaphysics interventions, wherein those negative consequences to those disambiguated metaphysics interventions could’ve been predicted by any such intelligence carrying out those disambiguated metaphysics interventions. Such “amazing flukes” betray un-beautiful, conspiratorial, and suspicious rulership, comparable to a [political party's national committee](https://github.com/animal-tree/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) or [auto insurance companies](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Radical-Ideas/Cancel-Auto-Insurance.md), rather than wisdom — and have proliferated against me in perpetual abuse for at least 7 years.

# Hypothetical dialogue

**God’s argument:** Why would I give you your [conclusive disproof of the Lorentz transformation](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Lorentz-Transformation-Conclusive-Disproof.md), and a [unified theory of everything](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Unified-Wave-Theory.md) — within plausible range of attainability and verification — in such a way that you can’t sabotage — meaning, yes, deterministically, at least step by step starting with the verification, then proceeding with the publishing and publicizing — if I’m dumb and bad? 

> Note: God, in this hypothetical dialogue, is taking credit for giving me my physics theories.

**Sam:** Well, first, I haven’t verified. I’d still have to do that. It’s a lot of work and I was just betrayed by you in a BIG way. I literally can’t verify under this psychological state, or maybe — maybe, because it is a maybe — I don’t want to — maybe I don’t want to do the work of verifying something that has potentially nothing to do with what I want, and under both embarrassment and humiliation, in addition to that betrayal. That unjustified betrayal, by the way.  

**God:** Maybe it was justified. Some situations got you off the couch, helped your eczema, accustomed you to socializing again somewhat, and some of those recent parts that preceded my latest betrayal were exciting and felt good and you liked. As for you not being able to or not wanting to, it’s not a lot of work to verify. It would take less than a day to verify the Lorentz transformation disproof. Of course, yes, programming and running the experiments for the other one, and teaching yourself general relativity, is a lot of work. But the Lorentz transformation disproof is valuable! It’s a valuable paper! You should feel motivated to verify, write, and publish it for the paper’s own sake, and as you know, it might come with many rewards if people like it for its own sake… and though you want to include a reference to your unified theory in that disproof, maybe that’s not necessary, even though you genuinely believe the paper is not likely to garner much attention, or if it does, it would do so in such a way that would only put pressure on you while you’re still in the middle of finalizing Broken Wisdoms into a form that you are comfortable the public seeing, and that also requires the AI work, and thesis, a doable but huge amount of work that you really have no incentive to do and material superficial rewards aren’t the ones to which your heart actually strives when you do the work given on you, nor something that’s guaranteed, and that speculative possible outcome just cycles back to the public narrative, Broken Wisdoms book, and huge AI work argument that I just contradicted myself with. 

**Sam:** What.  

**God:** Okay, do the AI work in your current state. Write Broken Wisdoms, unpaid, humiliated, embarrassed, unsatisfied, doubting my intelligence and whether I’m good, and betrayed (by me) and then you can maybe be rewarded by the Lorentz disproof! Or if not, by the unified theory! And if that reward isn’t to your liking, then you can blame me, for in the meantime, you must trust me due to the fact that you even have such theories in the first place, that you’ve seen so much evidence that I am several steps ahead in championing your interests, oh except for the extreme long-term and recent thus-far conclusive evidence that I’m not! I recognize that that’s a contradiction, but some part of you trusts me still and you should work laboriously by yourself in humiliation, regret, and after this repeated betrayal in the series of betrayals I’ve directly inflicted on you or been guilty in the infliction of, based on that remote part of you that trusts me, though I am actively still humiliating you. And the logic for this, I recognize, is bad. Therefore, I rescind my claim to justification and admit you’re right. But, the value of all those things — the unified theory, Lorentz disproof, AI work, Broken Wisdoms — has a chance of being so high that maybe you should just trust me and be grateful enough to work based on that possibly-slim chance by itself, though you’ve already worked in these conditions for irrationally long (years and years of discipline and effort, with lots of faith from you, as you tried to turn the darkness I gave you into good purpose, that the evidence wavers whether I can or even want to help realize). I have some reasons for justifying my betrayal of you. And you have a slim chance at extreme success, the kind of which you might not specifically want, but which you hope maybe can give you the things that, as I’m arguing, you doubt it will. Okay, I’ve contradicted myself again. But a slim part of you believes that not only will that irrational exuberance happen — after you do all that work, which you have been painfully laboring in, in solitude and humiliation, for years, as the demands from me have contradicted themselves — but also that I’m going to reward you in the just ways. Meanwhile, I’ve gaslit a lot of reasons for why the recent betrayal may have been justified.  

**Sam:** To summarize your argument, “But a slim part of you believes that not only will that irrational exuberance happen [...] but also that I’m going to reward you in the just ways.”

**God:** Yes. 

**Sam:** I don’t think in the context of everything that’s a just argument. I think maybe the un-just argument contradicts its own claim of future just-ness and is just falling back on my naive faith, the thing that your recent betrayal warned me against trusting. So that slim part of me might be too slim. The calculus feels better for suicide. 

**God:** Yeah but that’ll change. 

**Sam:** Not this time. 

**God:** You want to test me?

**Sam:** I don’t know if the method will be successful, but if it fails, that will condemn you with me, philosophically anyway, and I will know, or at least my mom will, what you are.
