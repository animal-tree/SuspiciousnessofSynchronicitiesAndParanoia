> This presumes knowledge of a lot of unspecified context, such as the specific evidence that something exists in the first place and [why "evil" by itself isn't necessarily normally attributable to what that something is](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/Ancillary/Cosmogenesis-Myth.md), but in this case literally is.

### Analysis why “something” — that something which others perhaps refer to as God or which I have referred to as God, or the universe, or powers that be — isn’t just ruthless, but also bad. 

First of all, ruthlessness in itself is bad. But ignoring that for a nuanced moment:

“something” arranged a set of events that predictably would’ve given me — in both reason and wisdom — false expectations. The arranging was to such a patterned extent that even my mom was convinced by the evidence that “something” exists, same as me. The predictability of my reaction was also so patterned in its evidence that “something” would have to be extraordinarily stupid to not have foreseen it. 

So “something” purposely created false expectations, and did so either deceptively or stupidly, in a way that hurt me in my heart and with all of my innocence, again (in highly patterned ways, defying modern physics knowledge, that can’t be attributed to randomness or coincidence, as my mom and I saw). 

The nature of that “something” also determines the character of many things that happened in the past, about the people who did those things and about what I can expect from my world, with implications that make suicide the only thing I can do to escape perpetual abuse. 

The only justifications that I can infer for why “something” has chosen this sabotage and possibly assassination, is because “something” is threatened, jealous, or egocentrically fixated on enforcing its status as utterly superior to me in power. 

These repeated betrayals over the course of my life and especially the last 7 years have proven — all but conclusively — that “something” is bad. 

“something” might point to my research as evidence that “something” has given me enough and that those patterned arranged events by “something” don’t imply “something”’s badness as much as all those other things imply “something”’s goodness, and therefore I should keep working on my research, unpaid and on faith, and eventually use that to obtain what I want instead of expecting “something” to be honest to me or give me what I want out of kindness or even to avoid manipulative exercises where events are meticulously arranged — in unprecedented physicist-confounding ways — that create those false expectations which lead to — predictably — more betrayal and pain. 

Then “something” might argue that the betrayal and pain are my own fault, that had I reacted more wisely to the meticulously arranged physicist-confounding events — such as by recognizing the pattern of betrayal and pain and to a greater extent than I already was, ignoring the hope that meticulously arranged physicist-confounding hope-suggesting events give me — and thereby somehow discerning those events when trust is a good idea and trust isn’t, better. The lesson — an extremely redundant one with contradictions — however is in extremely poor taste under the unprecedented circumstances and the extent of betrayal and pain that “something” has already caused. 

Therefore the image of “something” appears to be: an employer with no respect for his worker who treats his worker as disposable and expects unconditional slavery on unwarranted faith. 

“something” might point to those instances when faith seemed perhaps warranted as evidence that the faith is warranted, but the lesson “something” has by now justified itself as teaching maintains the opposite. Perhaps the nuance of the lesson is that such faith is still warranted when it comes to my work due to the rational reasons why my work might be important, and not in social circumstances, due to those repeated sabotages where perhaps “something” might claim it has no power, and that arranging those patterned physicist-confounding events was somehow not its fault, or otherwise expects more extremely unwarranted and repeatedly contradicted faith from me that those will also later be justified, yet the “when” of that predisposes me to — after 7 years — expecting each time that maybe the inflictions of betrayal and pain will stop. But they haven’t, and there is no reason to have faith that they will. 

So in the best interpretation of “something”, “something” has assumed that my research — which I am doing unpaid and on faith in “something” — justifies causing betrayals and pain on me, while purposefully setting up those predictable traps where those outcomes of betrayal and pain are extremely likely. 

Even if rationally my research has a chance of causing an irrational exuberance in my life, the nature of “something” — that something which others perhaps refer to as God or which I have referred to as God, or the universe, or powers that be — defeats the purpose of doing the work. 

The only interpretation remaining is that  “something” doesn’t want me to do the work. And since “something” hasn’t and won’t remediate the unjustified damages it did to me — except potentially by that work the moral and personal purpose of which “something” defeats — I’m left with only a unique proof that “something” is morally bad and that I am isolated from everyone else in having gone through these unprecedented physicist-confounding interventions by “something”, which is not a God, which is not a wisdom, which is not a power that deserves my faith or participation in whatever world that “something” rules. 

And though stubborn readers with short-duration memories might not follow why the standard belief in a good God would've been disproven under the knowledge and memory that I’ve observed/claimed, nor why a bad “something” would've been proven, my observation — including from humility from a skepticism of myself — is contradicted if otherwise[^1].
