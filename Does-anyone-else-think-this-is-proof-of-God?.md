I'm a PhD student tentatively planning to put the formalization of the math of this in my thesis under a mathematical and rigorous framing with my interpretations.

**For a TLDR: Scroll to the bullets 2/3 into this document.**

1. I went through severe traumas, rapidly in succession, extremely severe, including a combination of medical malpractices.
2. One of them involved losing all of my hair. I'm a Jewish guy with brown hair with no hereditary predisposition to baldness. Due to chance situations involving a biologic agent for eczema called Dupilumab, my insurance, and my doctor, I lost all of my hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes, perhaps permanently.
3. After deteriorating mental health, I had a sudden psychosis where on Christmas, 2018 (entirely by coincidence), at night, thinking my mom was drowning, I jumped into a frozen sewage brook to save her. After I crawled out and was immobile in the woods, I envisioned resurrecting as my wheelchair-bound neighbor, a 50-something year-old Ukrainian man named Volyoda who depended functionally on his 80-something mom, and was a piss-smelling, alcoholic, registered-sex-offender (yes, this whole situation was traumatizing, but not as much as what followed). In the resulting hospitalization I was coerced against my will to take high doses of benzos, a drug whose long-term application doesn't help the underlying issues of schizophrenia or whatever I had, by clinicians that contradicted themselves and each other about the duration of the prescription, and before month 4, I was brain damaged by the drug, and in excruciating agony due to the GABA downregulation induced by that drug.
4. At that point, I was pretty much as debilitated and dependent on my mom as my next door neighbor Volyoda (on his) who I'd envisioned myself resurrecting as. Some long time after, just before I started recovering, he had a sudden psychosis, thought his mother was dying, which is what I'd thought when I jumped into the brook to save mine, and died. In other words, he had a psychosis revolving around thinking his mother was dying, much like I did many months back, and died. He, the handicapped man I envisioned in the woods resurrecting as when I'd crawled out of the freezing brook, died in that psychosis, just as my recovery from the benzo traumas began.
5. I'm gonna go over the similarities between Volyoda and me:
     - Neither of us had prior histories of psychosis.
     - He was an alcoholic, and benzos, which were coerced on me, are like alcohol.
     - He was a sex offender, and after losing all of my hair and being brain damaged, combined with pre-existing social anxiety, I was a complete sexual/romantic exile. I wasn't a sex offender, but that's how rejected I felt. I felt as though that might've as well been my status in society.
     - He was the neighbor who lived in the apartment unit diagonally across the hallway from mine. Meaning, not the one across. If he had moved into the one across, that would've been far worse, since that was the one where my grandparents had lived in. When my mom, sister, and I moved to America when I was 3ish/4, we moved in with my grandparents into this apartment. Then later, around when I was in middle or high school, my grandparents moved to the unit right across the hallway from ours, with the doors facing each other and just a few steps away. Volyoda hadn't lived in this apartment building yet. Volyoda's apartment was inhabitted by a Rabbi. And there is a different Ukrainian man, much older, named Goergen, who lives upstairs from where my grandma's unit was, who is not Volyoda. 
6. After that, after Volyoda died,  almost as if it was the universe symbolizing, I finally started to recover from the benzo traumas and regain independence. Really eerie/fucked up, that the "resurrection" vision I had came true somewhat symbolically/synchronistically, and that I started recovering after he died, and he died in that manner in a psychosis centered around thinking his mom was dying, but so far could be just a disturbing coincidence, in all likelihood. However, take note of the fact that I felt like a total reject, and believed that nobody would ever be interested in me again, after losing all of my hair and the benzo traumas. Take note, because that turns out to be a much bigger coincidence/synchronicity.
8. During this recovery, I derived, programmed, wrote, archived, and submitted to a top-venue conference my ["Taylor-CAM"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper. I'm a PhD student, the brain damage really fucked me up, this was a huge feat. It turned out to be my first published paper. One week later, somebody began interacting with me through Facebook. Her name was Tayler.
9. Some more relationship background. I saw a few people for 2-3 months each in college, and had a good social life in college, but I have little relationship experience actually, and the likelihood of finding a girlfriend empirically didn't measure high for me, especially after having lost my hair (including eyebrows and eyelashes) and the wrinkles that the benzo trauma caused on my face, as well as the effect of the neurological damage on my cognition, and the effect of the medically-induced trauma on my trust in people. On top of losing all my hair and being brain damaged and traumatized, I felt hopeless. I joined an ironic Facebook body image group that my college theater director posted about, about people who feel they're ugly. If it weren't for the earlier traumas, I would've never written in it (and, as it'll turn out [at least at time of original writing], that would've been a good thing, because more unbelievability is yet to follow). If I didn't lose my hair and go through what I did — multiple repeated unlikely tragedies (that are so extreme in severity and intensity that they're best referred to as "acts of God"), I wouldn't have joined that Facebook group to post once about my body image issues, shortly after my Taylor-CAM paper. But that one post is also how I met Tayler, in that group of "ugly people", and she was sooo not ugly.
10. Shortly after archiving my Taylor-CAM paper, she commented on my post in that Facebook group joking about cosplaying together as Katara and Aang. After I responded, and after inviting me to message her and us getting along really well, she tells me she used to be a cam-girl. Okay, "Taylor-CAM," her name's "Tayler," she was a cam-girl, beautiful woman 2 years younger than me starts interacting with me of her own accord exactly a week after my paper, no big deal. 
11. I thought I was perhaps the world's only bald Jewish guy. However, apparently, her ex-husband (she's in her early 20s but literally insane) (I mean that kindly) was a bald Jewish guy. And she actually suffered a severe life-destroying tragedy that Christmas night, 2018 I did, involving him. The night of my psychosis that paralleled Volyoda's, was also the night of her own life-destroying trauma, with her bald Jewish husband, that led to their divorce. Yeah, that's a big coincidence. She and I suffered major traumas on the same already-synchronistic night, mine involving a child-porn-addicted sex-offender, and hers involving a bald Jewish guy sex-offender. Edit: The child-porn detail will make sense in a moment.
12. She left him after that sex-offense, and saw at least one other guy after, then we began messaging. I had such a severe eczema outbreak after we started interacting that I wasn't able to take her up on any of our plans or her offers to meet. She'd even offered to pay for my plane tickets one night, pulling up the billing on her phone and sending me a photo, to New Orleans, a trip she and her friend were drinking in a hotel in, and also the same city where her trauma with the bald Jewish guy happened, also far away from where they live(d), that she associates with that trauma. She trusted me, a lot, is the point, and not out of stupidity —  we connected so well. I trusted her too. I should've gone, but she gave me one night's notice and I still had eczema. The new connection with her was a bigger deal to me than she understood and realized, including later learning of and finding the content she had on the internet. I wanted to see what kind of content she did, so she sent me a blowjob video she'd done with her roommate. She accidently sent me her porn name in one of the things she sent, and I last-minute stupidly looked up her other stuff, which I regret, including learning that that guy she was rooming with and did that blowjob video with was her ex-boyfriend, who she started seeing quickly after leaving the bald Jewish guy after her trauma. She also sent me a photo that I thought was personally for me, that meant a lot to me, and then she made it her profile picture. Other things she sent me were also on different accounts on the internet. I got emotionally weird, awkward, and never ended up getting to meet her. She lost interest in me, and I wanted her to visit rather than me visiting. I was so devastated that I was hospitalized. After I got out, I learned she was going on dates (but in person) with other guys, and I even saw photos of it on social media. She and I stopped chatting around the time of our shared birthdays, days apart in November (and she blocked me). Then I was hospitalized again. More synchronicities followed after that, and some preceded.
13. Yes, birthdays in the same week. 
14. A year later, while I'm still in severe grief, genuinely traumatized about missing that chance (she gave me so many chances; offered to pay for my plane tickets; offered to drive all the way to New York), my paper gets its first citation. This happens a week after my mom kills a hornet in front of me. We're immigrants and my mom doesn't always know English really well. I didn't like that she did that because of the uncertainty of the nature of consciousness and whether bugs can feel the pain that we do. I still have the text that I sent her about killing the hornet, and she asked me what a "hornet" is, and I replied via text "A type of bee." The paper that cited me a week later was called "HORNET" and it cited Taylor-CAM. Er, "swarm of bees" is something Tayler used to monicker herself. But the killing a hornet thing — viscerally, like in one of those moments you know are vivid, as my mom did against the pane of our outer apartment door — sending that text explanation of what a "hornet" is, and then being independently cited by some research group for their HORNET model — a week later — was the last coincidence I needed around this single thread of events to infer some causality (though it still wasn't the last, and more synchronicities, as recently as this last year, including still a good number that I haven't specified...). It's also possible the HORNET synchronicity was meant to call me a "whore" and a bug, since towards the latter interactions with Tayler, I was still [emotionally] whoring myself out trying to regain her affection, even from the first hospitalization where I left an embarrassing set of voicemails, apologizing to her and literally crying, and she was, kind of, treating me like a bug.
    - However, those calls actually worked, temporarily. We did talk after that and text more for some time, even restart flirting again for a moment. 
16. The aftermath of Tayler for me was a lot of heartbreak, and hospitalization(s), and buried fear and trauma, as well as later confusion over all of these synchronicities which seemed like either missed rewards or punishments, or gaslighting manipulations by potentially-occult physical non-local planning mechanisms of the universe, that some people probably wouldn't have interpreted preemptively as proof of God.
17. For the record, I study consciousness. My psychoses were largely centered around unintended investigations of that and followed realizing certain things in AI (prior to my brain damage) that at the time were extremely ahead of their time, and today are (some of them anyway) widespread. I have documented evidence of this as well. I have email records, an Overleaf document, other works with time-stamped GitHub code, I proposed some of those ideas for my area exam in front of lots of people, and have notes in the thousands scribbled about these questions. Heck, my Facebook bio (where I met Tayler) was "trying to understand consciousness mathematically, spiritually, and pretentiously" at the time we met via Facebook. The years prior to that, I was having pretty big, and rational, physics ideas about God. In the context of that research, these "acts of God" and extreme coincidences are made even more coincidental.
18. Edit: During the time she and I were talking/texting, my hair fully grew back. It fell out again starting from around when we stopped talking/texting, starting in December, after our birthdays. During the time before and when it started growing back, despite receiving the content that I got, I was practicing strict asceticisms for my health, including strict diet, daily meditation, cold, showers, and a rule for myself: no porn, movies, or TV shows. All of this I was doing when I lost my hair, but notably my diet during this time was even stricter, steak/salmon-only. I think the social factor with Tayler also helped. But to summarize: my neighbor died the subsequent year as my vision, via a similar psychosis, and two huge synchronicities happened exactly weeks apart from major paper milestones around my Taylor-CAM paper, and more synchronicities, unspecified (including one I should probably specify that happened just before she and I started interacting, in the same week). I also left unspecified the particular specifics of the trauma that Tayler went through with that bald Jewish guy, her husband, on that same 2018 Christmas night, which was also severe and out of the ordinary, and caused their divorce: She was kidnapped (to New Orleans) and raped. Volyoda was a child-porn sex-offender. That linguistic connection to "kid"-napped (and “New” Orleans) is synchronistic in my opinion. Or perhaps it had to do with my inexperience and naivete, or a message from the universe about the accessibility of synthetic coping mechanisms like porn to literal boys, [edit: although I suppose the reverse could be said, since she was fascinated with Disney]. She blocked me before either of us realized any of these synchronicities, and I later tried delivering this to her. This has implications on physics, medicine, my entire life, all of theology, and perhaps everybody's lives for all of history.
    - Orléans, in France, is the city the teenager Joan of Arc sieged. [“Claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of France.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc) 

However, the miracle-like chance of me getting along with this person who I liked, reciprocated my feelings, and who I thought was like insanely attractive (and who somehow reciprocated that too), turned out to be a tragedy. After all the "amazing flukes" (as my Rabbi called them), the relationship didn't work out. It was like some good was finally rising to power to justify the earlier trauma, and it didn't. Like... [idk, like Bernie Sanders losing the election](https://github.com/animal-tree/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md) during that summer, is the best analogy that comes to mind for me. And after that followed more independent unlikely events and traumas. I'm more traumatized than ever [at time of writing], despite how lucid these words may sound. There's a lot to infer about the nature, and perhaps physical non-omnipotent nature (limitations), of cosmic forces/God/Whatever you want to call it from this set of fairly-well verifiable/digitally-recorded-and-time-stamped-or-formally-archived coincidental events. I'm thinking about if I can put a lot of the philosophical/physics meanings of this in my thesis by the way if I conceptualize a formal way to do it and can sneak it into a strong enough containing framework credibly [[e.g., like this](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/quackery.md)], with a more mathy and rigorous angle than I'm presenting here. In my opinion, these events are too unlikely to rationally dismiss. I'm just despairing that the ultimate judgement about the nature of God is that, he's incredibly powerful (can synchronize non-local events in both symbolically and psychologically and behaviorally meaningful ways), but not good. I torment myself every day for missing and missing and missing.

Oh oh, one more thing. My hair fully grew back when she and I were talking and fell out again when we stopped (that's medically rare for alopecia universalis, let alone the timing). We bonded through the summer and my hair grew back August - November. Oh and our birthdays are in the same week (November). That week is when we stopped talking and my hair fell out again in December. So it's not just a theological question, but a biological and medical one. This occurred >2 years after my induced alopecia universalis, a statistically unlikely medical outcome for someone with that condition and eczema. The Taylor-CAM paper was by the way a statistics paper.

Keep in mind, I'm embarrassed by that paper. I wrote it while brain damaged. I had [another one](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) on MHDPA that I wrote in 2018, well before anyone at my university heard of Transformers (e.g. ChatGPT).  I submitted it as a class project for an NLP class, got an A (innovating on this method underlying ChatGPT 5 years before ChatGPT), suddenly suffered these previously-unprecedented consciousness severities, got hospitalized, barely finished it for NeurIPS (back then, NIPS)  in the hospital, and then brain damage due to the benzo coercions, switching advisors and labs... I ended up writing Taylor-CAM instead while brain damaged (due to the new advisor requiring I submit a computer vision paper, a different field at the time, and on a deadline). I worked very hard. The original meant more to me because it was more-mine (without brain damage) and the world's first MHDPA/transformer innovation (not sure even Schmidhuber's counts, since that wasn't an innovation on MHDPA, but a predecessing variant) ever. But it got rejected for not the best reasons (number of experiments I was able to run) and the reviewers hadn't even heard of MHDPA. I resubmitted one more time and it got rejected again and then "gave up" due to switching labs and changed requirements. It's still fine and probably could be turned into something.
___

I was also put on a physics project shortly after having some physics ideas (only by coincidence, I didn't share those ideas with my advisor who forced me on that project). Many of my ideas are gaining popularity in philosophy circles but without the long trialling process of thinking about and suffering them, and it pains me to watch as tons of derivatives of something that used to be my niche research area become widespread, while I still have zero credit to my name. A bio paper a few months back hit me the hardest, because that one was personal, and I'd shared it (the concrete idea, not the paper) years before the paper with my advisor and a whole class and my next advisor, involving biologically-inspired neurons.

God forbid I have the morale to actually write something and get credit.
___
That MHDPA paper was back in the days of TensorFlow 1.0. I had to program it declaratively in Sonnet. My school was confused why I kept describing it as "relational reasoning." I included one equation to describe MHDPA (the standard one, that is now the mathematical convention for describing MHDPA) and the rest of the equations to describe my innovation, and was told "it's not enough math" regarding the former as the main advice.

I proposed vision transformers in my area exam and passed "with flying colors", however I had to take a lot of benzos that day because I was in severe withdrawal and incapacitated/debilitated severely. Still got a master's degree! The vision transformers were actually mentioned off-handedly as just a way to generate relational representations from image features for sending into a neural episodic/longterm memory.

My vision from back then is still ahead of where the art is today, just saying.

However, I'm now funded by the mech-e department to do physics modeling and have been institutionalized [those two times] since. Therefore, and for other reasons, I'm just watching as the world takes my ideas, that, by the way, I suffered quite a lot for.

> Wow, reading this back I can tell there is something in my linguistics that wants to make me seem unconvincing.
>
> I was many months in withdrawal from those benzos that were coerced on me and that I argued against, that I had to take against my will in the hospital. The withdrawal was so bad, that I literally couldn't do 4*7. So yes, I had to — not wanted to — was forced to — take them in order to do my area exam. The "flying colors" are probably why I passed because they usually don't appreciate good ideas for their own sake.

You might be wondering why extremely unlikely but patterned phenomena suggests the existence of a hidden latent factor, and specifically God. Making that argument, among others, is what I'll reserve for math [at original time of writing], and, if I still give a shit, experiments.

My faith at this time of anything "good" existing is low, and that includes humanity. But I can see how this might turn out to be "good." I can, for example, reasonably sue for hundreds of millions of dollars. Multiple trauma-exponentiating malpractices, including others that I didn't mention, yes, there were others. After Tayler, there were more hospitalizations not relevant to the discussion of this writeup.  My life has in many ways paralleled Job, if you're familiar with that biblical story, except unlike Job it's always been kind of bad. It's about an otherwise righteous man who lost everything except his wife and some friends, and you have no idea. But in the end, there was a deus-ex-machina and God restored his fortunes and maybe that's what's happening. So maybe these extremely unlikely successive rapid tragedies ("acts of God") will be balanced by successive extremely unlikely rapid immense good fortunes.

I guess until then, if it happens, we're just left with a puzzling set of claims from a guy you don't know.

- My Ukrainian neighbor, who I'd envisioned resurrecting as, died in exactly the psychosis-context I had on the Christmas night I jumped into the freezing sewage brook to save my mom  (P(A) < 1%)
- the same Christmas night as Tayler's independent trauma with another bald Jewish guy miles away years before we met   (P(B | A) < 1%)
- the same Tayler who I met incidentally through a group on body image issues that I was only part of because of an extremely unlikely medical malpractice  (P(C | A, B) < 1%)
- and even extremely unlikelier, a second independent malpractice involving benzos and brain damage;  (P(D | A, B, C) < 1%)
- she happened to respond to one of those posts joking about cosplaying together as Katara and Aang, initiating with me just after my Taylor-CAM paper, my first published paper  (P(E | A, B, C, D) < 1%)
- someone named Tayler who was a cam-girl
- with whom the relationship tragically and painfully for me fell apart on our shared birthdays in November in large part due to my immature/inexperienced hangups about that, including that her roommate was a guy she'd done a very intimate oral video with, and that she was seeing other guys (including after having told me on the phone she loved me), while treating me like a bug
- a paper that was later cited by HORNET, one of my first citations, *a week after* my mom whose primary language is Russian very-vividly kills a hornet in front of me (P(G | A, B, C, D, E, F) < 1%) and I'd memorably explained to her what it means by text ("A hornet is a type of bee.") 
- and me being a guy where all of these things were somewhat firsts (and Tayler finding me attractive, despite her being conventionally-speaking extremely "out of my league," and she wasn't a catfish), and Tayler having joked about being a swarm of bees
- while I'm studying consciousness, while I'm having revelatory and quite interesting physics ideas, a year before, coincidentally, being assigned to the mechanical engineering department to do, what else, physics modeling as an AI student, just by chance, while very-publicly (in different, social-media circles, [edit: namely, just my Facebook bio]) professing/including-as-bio that I'm learning about consciousness mathematically, spiritually, and socially. While genuinely being the world's expert in deep learning  (joke proba of <1e-10 here, but actually, both being the world's expert and the probability of that being low; see above referring to the world's earliest MHDPA innovation)
- during that summer, my head hair fully grew back >2 years after losing it August - November after Alopecia Universalis and fell out beginning December/January  (P(H | A, B, C, D, E, F, G) < $\epsilon$%, where $\epsilon$ at this point suggests our Null Hypothesis, as a distribution of standard impartial mechanics, doesn't capture the full power and intelligence of the universe) — yes, at the end of that same summer
  - I had also done an all-steak diet at that time, but the causal mechanisms of all of these independent, non-local phenomena don't negate the coincidence of their synchronous timings.

Growing up as an atheist, it took a lot of creative scientific thought, revelatory manias, and objective synchronistic events to convince me that there absolutely is *something*. I can share what that something might be, how it might work, and the scientific, experiential, and data-centric reasons for believing in it rationally, intelligently, and credibly.

The next step: convince me that there's something *good*. But under the same level of scrutiny. (Noting that losing those things/never-meeting-her was an extra 2 years, and counting for social circumstances as recent as this month, of unmentioned trauma, and synchronistic events, including another of my 40-60ish year-old neighbors going insane in a synchronistically macabre — or in this case, literally violent — way against me, and multiple hospitalizations, as well as trauma that preceded any/all of this)
- Recently, about 4 and a half years after my psychosis, the neighbor who moved into the apartment unit that used to belong to my grandparents, had a psychotic episode that revolved around me — was banging on our door and screaming that he would beat me up if I came out every day for about a month — and then had to move out (we didn't make him move out, nor press charges, but I think he just chose to when his episode ended). The Rochester Police Department and other neighbors intervened, visited, and heard (the Rochester Police Department can fully confirm). His episode was entirely unprompted. The most I ever interacted with him was holding open the door to the main apartment unit for him. He was the second neighbor in our 4-unit building hallway to have a psychosis and disappear in a way that was extremely-disturbing and synchronistic. But that neighbor's episode is part of a different thread of synchronicities, that requires its own focus and that I've not elaborated on here, but perhaps bigger and even less believable.

Whether these probabilities can be used as components of a p-value stat depends on how well the Null Hypothesis distribution is quantified. In this case, me. But one distribution can be biassed, as is often the case in p-value reliant literature. This is known as p-hacking. To compute a good personal opinion, this is sufficient. To make it rigorous, it needs a peer-review distribution of experts. That is, a mixture of experts model. Then it's a sound aggregate estimate of the Null Hypothesis, if enough versions of me can corroborate that my estimation of the Null Hypothesis probabilities is within approximate bound. In other words, what do you think? If you agree that the described factual events, both independently and conditionally, are unlikely, below the standard 0.05 aggregate, then we have a proof, of something, assuming I'm telling the truth.

Since standard scientific literature uses a simple probability model like a Gaussian to estimate a Null Hypothesis, or a best-fit regression model, I can also ask an LLM what it thinks, to align with those flawed but standard methods as well. I'm not doing that because I think the biological brain is by far the most reliable distribution in modern existence for estimating a Null Hypothesis for complex world events as described here. 

If this reasoning sounds flawed to you, I challenge you to find one accepted fact in all of science, except in axiomatic math, that doesn't reduce to the same principle. You might think you've found one, but you haven't. We can argue it out if you want.

Of course, we have to be reasonable in how we define our distributions. Ultimately, that's what conscious intelligence is. For example, I'm 1 of 8 billion people. Yes, it's unlikely as me, but those probabilities have to be weighed like so: "What is the probability that this event, and these other events, would happen to ANY one person?" In all of the galaxies and spacetime, perhaps the odds go up significantly if we consider that humans exist on other planets as well, but the odds of that are low. I'm assuming what i know about the Earth and treating myself as just some random stranger, but knowing that these events happened. Axiomatically, my memories are my main "assumptions", which you don't have. But all of peer-review rests on the faith that people beyond ourselves are telling the truth and faith that people beyond ourselves are capable of making credible observations based on their own memories and documented evidence and witnesses to those memories, as per a court of law. It boils down to, what do you think? Would you say, if you had to, what these probabilities might be? Some of us might say "Well, there's no way to know!" In that case, you can propose a confidence bound to your prediction (e.g. give a score from some defined low range to some defined high range of how sure you are). Some of us might more confidently say, "this is really unlikely." In all odds, most people would say "this is really unlikely but I'm not sure at all." And then the p-value would be well below 0.05 but the error margin would be enormous. In that case, we have a well-argued reasonable belief, which is already a contribution to much of theology's logical foundation, but not a proof. It would suggest "there probably is something, and we lean towards knowing that, but we don't have enough faith in ourselves to really conclude that there is, and that's good, because skepticism is good." However, the needle then points stronger to 'there is' than 'there isn't' and many people could use an actual scientific proof of at least that much. And at the least, that's what I think these memories of mine prove to me at least.

And again, most scientists just use Gaussian estimates. Data-centric reasoning is good, but the equivalent here would be to ask an LLM what it thinks. For complex world distributions, people are better. The biological brain is theorized and evidenced to follow a Bayesian reasoning structure, meaning, obviously, it's a more sophisticated distribution than a basic Gaussian.

As for how and why these events having a p-value <0.05 can be interpretted as implying "something", and what that something might be, and all the goddamn math, I have to write more. To quote myself from a moment ago: The next step: convince me that there's something *good*. But under the same level of scrutiny.

So much context has been left out (that would lower those 11 probabilities further, not increase them).[^1]

[^1]: Edit: There were many more extremely improbable, structured, patterned, un-random, unlikely-to-be-accident, usually-tragic synchronicities, where the explanation of them being coincidence is absurd. This whole essay turned out to barely even scratch the surface of the synchronicities that have occured since, or that I realized occured during this time period and earlier. This document now describes perhaps an average "synchronicity thread" in what is a composition of synchronicity threads in my life, some less extreme, some as extreme, some more extreme than this one. By the way, I [very much do not think this is proof of God yet](https://github.com/animal-tree/Suicide-Notes). After the combination of medical malpractices, including hair loss, benzo torture, benzo brain damage, benzo trauma, abuses in hospitals, [psychoses](https://github.com/animal-tree/BrokenWisdoms-TheReturnofNort), "catatonia," rejection, termination, the hardest work, giving constant unconditional love to people while only having the same from my mom, [the universe's](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia-2/blob/main/Evidenced-Interpretation.md) own synchronistic inflictions of injustice... for years without end... the number of things I've been through are beyond the reader's ability to imagine, and the universe itself has disambiguated its interventions against me. Tayler once wrote to me: "you're going through something I can't comprehend". Aside from the possibility of responding with love (with or without scientific curiosity), that's probably the only good reply to this.
